# About #

ChocoTest is a web-based online testing (as in exam) application.

ChocoTest use a sophisticated dynamic questions randomization systems that generates different set of question for each test participant. However, ChocoTest still ensure that each participant have the same total question weightage and the same number of question that you have specified, so there's no "luck factor" excuse for your test participants.

ChocoTest also features a rich question editor that support commonly used word processor features and image handling/uploading. And you can even create the question in a word processor (or even spreadsheet) and paste it directly to the editor. No more double-work of reformatting.

All of these came a friendly user interface that can be easily used by you as an administrator or by your test participants. And it's user interface is also very customizable, you can dramatically change the look and feel of the application by creating your own stylesheet file.

Last but not least, ChocoTest is a free and open-source software. ChocoTest is licensed under the very simple MIT License (no more cryptic legal text :) which (literally) means that you can do almost everything you want (but no, you can't eat it, it will not satisfy your hunger) with it as long as you retain the copyright notice.

Developed in PHP with the help of CakePHP (a great PHP framework) and jQuery (a great JavaScript framework), ChocoTest can be used with most of PHP-ready web hosting, and it's pretty simple to set it up on your own server (or computer) too.

The hardest task to do with ChocoTest is creating (and answering) the question itself!
